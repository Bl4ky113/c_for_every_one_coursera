## History of C

Created on 1972 by Dennis Ritchie. It's purpose was creating a operating system called unix.
It was released as free software, free as in freedom. 

It was also developed for small and 'micro' computers of that era. 
Which normally where big and very pricy computers.

It powers Linux and the bases of MacOs.

## compiler

We need to compile everything before using it. We can use gcc, and just pass the file name as a 
parameter, but if we want a nice output file and not a.out we can add a -o flag and pass the output name/path

## \#define

It's a way to create a constant value, such like PI, we just define the variable name, and then
the compiler will fill the constant value on each place that we used that name.

Saving us memory.
